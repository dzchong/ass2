      <div id="p1">Beef</div>
      <p> Once you cook beef to a certain point, the starting quality becomes less relevant. The act of cooking does particular things to the proteins, and also begins to render fat. A high quality piece of meat will have delicate fat marbling. Cook that to well done, and you are literally removing all the facets of the steak that made it high quality to begin with.

      <div id="p2">Chicken</div>
      <p>
        for those who want the basics, it cooks a 20 -25 lb ish bird in 1.5-2 hrs (brine it how you want or don't before hand) about 20lbs of charcoal 1/3 on top the rest at the base, make sure that there is no air leak into where the bird is. remove garbage can, remove bird, cut up bird that is preferably not been reduced to carbon. Enjoy!

      <div id="p3">Sushi</div>
      <p>
        Some sushi snobs will go as far as to say you must eat a particular type of sushi, a particular type of way, and wash it down with a particular type of drink- anything else is a bastardization. You, however, should not be concerned with tradition right now. You are paying for a service you want to enjoy, so enjoy it however you feel will give you the most satisfaction. If you find that sushi is for you, the tradition will come later and give you a different, deeper sense of satisfaction. You can't, however, get to know a tradition if you do not know yourself. Enjoy it however you like.
